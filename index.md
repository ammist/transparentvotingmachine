**The Transparent Voting Machine** is an interactive art installation that encourages participants to viscerally experience the process of voting using a simple, transparent, mechanical process. The project encourages learning and discussion about many aspects of voting and elections in the US.

The Transparent Voting Machine will debut at a popular street festival in October: the Oaktoberfest in the Dimond, a community-organized outdoor beer festival during which attendees are encouraged to vote for their favorite brewery. This harkens back to early American elections, when voters and their families gathered together on a festival-like day that resembles a block party more than our current election day.

This project is suitable for any event or exhibition where people may be encouraged to express a preference. The machine can be configured for a variety of ballot types, such as winner-take-all and instant runoff voting.  

The machine itself consists of a faceplate, a large lever, plastic balls representing votes, and a series of tubes and hoppers for collecting votes. These will be made of a transparent material so observers can see how the entire mechanism works.

Participants vote by placing balls into holes in the faceplate, and pulling a lever to release the balls into corresponding hoppers. The tabulation of votes can happen in a public or private, using graduated chambers to simplify the process, at preset intervals (or at the end of the day or event).  

While waiting to cast votes, participants will be able to read about the historical context of voting on three educational posters. Depending on the event where the voting is taking place, barkers and theatrical players can be involved to liven up the festivities and bring aspects of the history and story of voting to life.

With multiple machines, we could demonstrate each of these different kinds of voting, or allow more than one person to vote at a time.
