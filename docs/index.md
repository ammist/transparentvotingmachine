## The Transparent Voting Machine


The Transparent Voting Machine is an interactive art installation that encourages participants to viscerally experience the process of voting using a simple, transparent, mechanical process. The project encourages learning and discussion about many aspects of voting and elections in the US.

The Transparent Voting Machine will debut at a popular street festival in October: the Oaktoberfest in the Dimond, a community-organized outdoor beer festival during which attendees are encouraged to vote for their favorite brewery. This harkens back to early American elections, when voters and their families gathered together on a festival-like day that resembles a block party more than our current election day.
