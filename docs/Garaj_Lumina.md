## Garaj Lumina

We are a small collaborative of civic-minded nerds who make cool, mind-expanding art. Anca Mosoiu has been teaching people how to use technology through kids’ camps and all-ages workshops at her company, Tech Liminal, since 2009.  She is responsible for running the “People’s Choice” voting at the Oaktoberfest. Michael Schrecker is a filmmaker and technologist who has created large-scale interactive art pieces.  Together, we’ve exhibited work at the Autumn Lights Festival since its inception.
